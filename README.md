# external_link_d7
Drupal 7 theme to create pages that are content but redirect immediately to external links.


INTRODUCTION
----------------
This is especially useful for menu links that should be featured and displayed among
other internal content, but need to link to an external source.


INSTALLATION
-----------------
Git clone or download this module. Enable this module.

Under Structure > Content Types you will see a new content type 'External Link'.

This content type will allow you to define a title, summary or description,
and url path for a link. This results in actual content existing on your site,
so that it can be listed among internal content on your website, while still redirecting
automatically to the external url you provide.

This module relies on Field Redirection
